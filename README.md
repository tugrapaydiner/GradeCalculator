## üßÆ The Mathematics Behind the Calculator

At its core, the Dynamic Grade Calculator employs a series of mathematical operations to ensure that each assessment's weight is accurately reflected in the final grade. Here's a breakdown of the process:

- **Score Normalization**: Convert raw scores into a percentage form to standardize the varying total points.
  
  `Normalized Score = (Earned Points / Total Points) * 100`

- **Weighted Grade Calculation**: Determine the influence of each individual assessment on the overall grade.
  
  `Weighted Grade = Normalized Score * (Weight / 100)`

- **Aggregated Weighted Grades**: Add all weighted grades to get a cumulative figure that considers the specified weights.
  
  `Aggregated Weight = Sum of all Weighted Grades`

- **Final Grade Determination**: Divide the aggregated weight by the sum of the individual weights, provided they total 100%.
  
  `Final Grade = Aggregated Weight / Total Weights * 100`

## üö¶ Getting Started

To embark on this journey of grade calculation enlightenment, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework) installed on your machine.
- Have [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) ready for the best development experience.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository using Git:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tugrapaydiner/GradeCalculator.git

## üìê Usage Guide

To get the most out of the Dynamic Grade Calculator, follow these user-friendly steps:

1. **Add Assessments**: Initiate your grading journey by clicking the 'Add Assessment' button. This allows you to create a new entry for each of your assessments.
   
2. **Enter Scores**: Input your scores in the format of `earned points/total points` (e.g., `28/30`). This represents the actual score you received.

3. **Assign Weights**: Specify the weight each assessment carries towards your final grade. Ensure the weights sum to 100% for accurate final grade computation.

4. **Observe the Results**: As soon as you enter your scores and weights, the calculated grades for each assessment and the overall final grade will automatically update.
